        <h1>HOBBIES AND OTHER SKILLS</h1>
        <p class="description">I once started a basketball training, so I have an average basketball skill, a pro to someone who has no idea about it.
            Swimming is also one of the skills i have acquired over the years and its one of my favourite hobbies,
             I really enjoy the water and a really good swimmer. Playing chess is also something i have practised,
              because it has a lot of logical thinking attached to it which really excites me, because as a person i ususally enjoy logical challenges. 
              Although i am perhaps rust in that aspect now, but im pretty confident, if i pick up a chess board anytime; will probably have a few losses but will be better in no time.
